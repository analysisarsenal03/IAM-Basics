# IAM Basics  
A clear, beginner-friendly breakdown of Identity & Access Management (IAM) concepts across Azure, AWS, and SAP.  
This repo is my personal study log, reference guide, and demonstration of how I understand identity, least privilege, and access governance in cloud environments.

---

## What This Repo Covers  

- Core IAM concepts  
- Azure Entra ID (Azure AD) identity basics  
- AWS IAM fundamentals  
- SAP security → cloud IAM mapping (SU01, PFCG, roles)  
- Joiner–Mover–Leaver lifecycle  
- Access troubleshooting checklist  
- Least privilege and role design principles  

This repo is NOT meant to be highly technical or coded – it’s meant to show **practical IAM understanding** that applies directly to real jobs.

## 1. IAM Core Concepts (Universal)  

###  Identity  
Who you are:  
- User  
- Service principal  
- Managed identity  
- Application account  

###  Authentication  
Proving it's really you (password, MFA, biometrics, certificates).

###  Authorization  
What you are allowed to do after you log in.

###  Least Privilege  
Give the minimum permissions required — nothing extra.

###  RBAC (Role Based Access Control)  
Assign *roles* to *groups* → assign *groups* to *users.*  
You don’t assign individual permissions directly.

###  Governance  
Reviews, cleanup, compliance checks, monitoring.

---

##  2. Azure IAM (Entra ID)  

###  Key Objects  
- **Users** – people or service accounts  
- **Groups** – role grouping (Security groups, M365 groups)  
- **Roles** – permissions bundles  
- **Apps / Enterprise Apps** – SSO and application identity  
- **Conditional Access** – rules (location, device, MFA)  
- **MFA** – multi-factor authentication  

###  Azure RBAC vs Entra RBAC  
**Entra ID RBAC:** identity-plane access  
(e.g., “User Administrator”)  

**Azure RBAC:** resource-plane access  
(e.g., “Storage Blob Data Contributor”)  

###  Access Flow in Azure  
User → Group → Role Assignment → Effective Permissions

---

##  3. AWS IAM  

###  Key Concepts  
- **Users**  
- **Groups**  
- **Roles**  
- **Policies** (JSON documents with permissions)  

###  AWS Permission Structure  
- Identity-based policies  
- Resource-based policies  
- Session policies  
- Permission boundaries  

###  Common AWS IAM Mistakes  
- Overuse of `AdministratorAccess`  
- Widcards (`s3:*`)  
- Inline policies everywhere  
- IAM users with long-term keys

##  4. SAP Security → Cloud IAM Mapping  

I previously worked with SAP ECC SU01, PFCG, composite/derived roles, and auth objects.  
These concepts translate directly into cloud IAM.

| SAP Concept | Cloud Equivalent |
|------------|------------------|
| SU01 User | Azure AD User / AWS IAM User |
| PFCG Role | Azure Role / AWS IAM Role |
| Auth Objects | IAM permissions / policy actions |
| Profiles | Permission bundles |
| Composite Roles | Group of roles / nested groups |
| Derived Roles | Role inheritance |
| USOBX / USOBT | Access rule definitions |
| SoD (Segregation of Duties) | Zero-trust + role conflict rules |
| User Master Data | User identity attributes / directory objects |

**Identity mindset is the same across platforms.**

##  5. Joiner – Mover – Leaver Lifecycle  

### Joiner  
- Create user  
- Assign base access  
- Enforce MFA  
- Add to job role groups  
- SSO setup  

### Mover  
- Modify access  
- Remove unnecessary permissions  
- Validate SoD rules  
- Update group membership  

### ✔ Leaver  
- Disable account  
- Remove access  
- Revoke sessions  
- Archive logs  
- Offboard completely  

Companies care **a LOT** about this lifecycle.

##  6. IAM Troubleshooting Checklist  

### If a user can't log in:
- Check MFA  
- Check Conditional Access rules  
- Check device compliance  
- Check if account is locked/disabled  
- Check SSO federation status  

### If a user lacks access:
- Check group membership  
- Check role assignment  
- Check resource inheritance  
- Check deny policies  
- Check access reviews / expired assignments  

### If permissions still don’t work:
- Check effective permission layers  
- Check policy evaluation logs  
- Check nested group behavior  

---

##  7. Least Privilege Principles  

- No direct role-to-user assignment  
- Always use groups  
- Break down access by job function  
- Review access regularly  
- Remove unused accounts  
- No long-term keys  
- Enforce MFA always  
- Reduce wildcard permissions  

IAM = preventing excessive access.

##  Why This Repo Exists  

I’m building a career in **IAM & Cloud Security**, and this repo documents the concepts I use, study, and practice.  
My background includes:

- SAP IAM (SU01, PFCG, roles)  
- Azure (AZ-104)  
- AWS (CP + SAA)  
- SOC / Tenable vulnerability internship  
- Cloud support & identity troubleshooting  

This repo shows how I think about identity and access across different systems.
